## Cover Letter
I am a statistician by education and a videographer by trade. As an investigative journalist, I combine those skills to tell compelling data driven visual stories.

Before graduate school, I was a video journalist at Newsy where I developed my visual storytelling skills. 

In order to hone my skills in investigative journalism, I decided to apply to graduate school. I wanted to gain more experience using computational methods to develop human-interest stories from complex datasets. Attending Merrill has taught me that I love collaborative investigations and I am enthusiastic about making data workflows more efficient. 

I was a co-leader on the data team for our investigation into how the Occupational Safety and Health Administration has failed to protect essential workers amid the coronavirus pandemic. I was responsible for organizing a team of seven data journalists. After observing the practice of team members sharing code scripts over slack, I implemented and taught members how to use GitHub, allowing us to version control our code and work collaboratively on the same files. I also introduced the habit of documenting our data in markdown files, enabling our team to keep track of data caveats, assumptions, and methodologies.

Along with in-depth analysis, as documented in my data portfolio, I led the creation of our fact check document. Our notebook shows the code and results that led to each sentence in the story generated by our original data analysis. 

I enjoy doing my data analysis in R and usually stick to Python to implement scalable pipelines and web scrapers. However, coding languages are just a tool, and I take every opportunity to expand my skills to solve complex problems. This summer on the Printing Hate investigation, I learned JavaScript to code a news app and computer vision techniques to identify and crop stories from newspapers. 

My first year of graduate school was mostly virtual and therefore resources to do visual projects were limited. In my last semester at Merrill I created the Howard Center's first mini documentary, based on reporting done for Printing Hate. 

I am currently deciding between two job offers. I was offered the xxx at xxx (redacted since hasn't been made public yet), and a potential job at Newsy as a video editor and animator. While at this time I have not decided which one I will be pursuing, both options would allow me to continue pursuing journalism through data and video. 

I believe that the responsible and creative pairing of visuals and data leads to more powerful narratives. I am excited to continue telling these stories after graduation.
